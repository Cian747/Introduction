    <h2>Here I will post my favourite activities.</h2>
    <p><q><strong>We all have a talent and a passion to do something. The onlt difference between the greats and us is they don't stop and scale their talents to the next level.</strong></q></p>
    <p>I participate actively in:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Art</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- Description -->

    <p>Our <a href="https://www.kenyaswimmingfederation.org/" target ="_blank">national swimming federation</a>selects athletes to represent our country each year.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In coding we all need to prepare for the <a href="https://www.techseries.dev/" target="_blank">market</a> ahead and need to be prepared.</p>
    <br>
    <p>art on the other hand is diverse. <em>Art</em> is somewhat hard to define. In my opinion <strong>Art is your passion studied and developed into your own technique and shared with the world.</strong></p>
    <p>Most times people will love the work you come up with.</p>
